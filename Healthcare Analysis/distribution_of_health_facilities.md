## DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTHCARE FACILTITIES IN KENYA: ANALYSIS OF DISPARITY IN FACILITY TYPE, OWNERSHIP AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY

### This project analyzes and interprets health facility data to propose actionable recommendations for improving access to quality healthcare in Nairobi, in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) and WHO standards.

### Using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, the analysis explores:

    1. Facility distribution across counties and provinces
    2. Ownership patterns (public vs private)
    3. Service availability for key health interventions (ART, FP, IPD, Youth services)
    4. Governance trends based on the job titles of facility in-charges
    5. Infrastructure gaps, including facilities lacking beds or cots

The findings highlight regional disparities, governance challenges, and service gaps that can inform policy and resource allocation.
The project concludes with data-driven recommendations to strengthen healthcare equity and infrastructure in underserved areas.
